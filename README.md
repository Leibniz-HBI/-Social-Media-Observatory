# Social Media Observatory

This repository is the central communication and project management interface for the Social Media Observatory hosted by the Leibniz Insitute for Media Research | Hans-Bredow-Institute (https://leibniz-hbi.de). It is meant to become an open and welcoming support ressource and knowledge exchange hub for researchers and journalists interested in and working with (social) media data.

A landing page describing the goals and the concept of the SMO in detail will be available in early 2020.
